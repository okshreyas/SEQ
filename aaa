Certainly! If you want to select the latest distinct values based on a specific column (`your_column`) where `q9` is equal to 0, you can modify the query like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY your_column ORDER BY feedback_date DESC) as row_num
    FROM your_table
    WHERE q9 = 0
) AS ranked
WHERE row_num = 1;
```

This ensures that only rows where `q9` is equal to 0 are considered, and then it selects the latest entry within each distinct value of the specified column (`your_column`). Adjust the column and table names according to your actual database schema.
